god release 0.01

		1. Short intro

This is open-source build system for building user-space applications.  Full
source code is included, and it has been used to build itself (quite an
achivement tbh).  There is cross-compilation, few compilers, notably both clang
and gcc and windres generation.  You need make, clang and ar to compile it, but
sadly it can't be ran on windows as it has quite a lot of hardcoded stuff which
I tried to fix but failed.

As the version number (0.01) suggests it is just a thing for a single project
which may not be used in others.  It only supports a small subset of compilers
and runners, so don't expect it to compile whole linux kernel, but a game can
be compiled easily.

Software you need to run god:
	- linux (wsl also works)
	- clang
	- gcc/g++ (mingw version for windows)
	- ar

x86_64 is hardcoded as I don't develop stuff on other achitecture. If somebody
is willing to port the runner and build system on other architecture you are
allowed to. If you get it running on windows without wsl do pull request as fast
as possible.
